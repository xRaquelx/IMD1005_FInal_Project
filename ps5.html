                    <p> The PlayStation 5 (PS5) is a gaming console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment in 2020.
                        It's the successor to the PlayStation 4 and has been designed to deliver high-fidelity immersive
                        gaming experiences with enhanced visual graphics, fast loading times, and new features such as
                        adaptive triggers on the controller and strong computing power. The PS5 has been around for
                        about 4 years and has yet to be topped in its gaming abilities.</p>

            <div class="how">
                <h3>How it works:</h3>
                <div class="how-container">
                    <p>The PS5 uses powerful hardware components, including a custom AMD CPU and GPU, fast SSD storage,
                        and
                        a high-speed memory system. One of the best features about the PS5 are that games from its
                        predecessor consoles (PS3, PS4) are able to be installed onto the console or can be played
                        directly
                        from compatible discs. The PS5 also has two versions: The Digital Edition, which can only
                        download
                        games onto its system, and the Disc Edition, which is able to handle both downloads and disc
                        insertion. Players interact with the system using the DualSense haptic controller, which
                        incorporates advanced technology like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback to enhance the
                        immersion
                        while gaming!</p>

                    <h3>Pricing - Where is it available:</h3>
                    <div class="price-container">
                        <img src="images/ps5-stock.jpg" alt="PS5-stock">
                        <p>The pricing of the PS5 varies depending on the availability and the specific model (standard
                            edition with a disc drive or digital edition without). A brand new console can range froma
                            anywhere from $500-$1000, depending on the extra peripherals given. As for availability,
                            it's
                            generally sold through various retailers both online and in physical stores, depending on
                            the
                            country or region. Availability can be limited due to high demand, especially during the
                            initial
                            launch period.</p>

                    <h3>Review</h3>
                    <p>My personal experience with the PS5 is quite positive. I have had it for about a year and have
                        had no complaints as of now. I would like to highlight its powerful hardware, fast loading
                        times, and innovative controller features. Its performance and the quality of exclusive titles
                        available on the platform is quite impressive and exclusive. However, I do have an issue with
                        the relatively high price compared to previous console generations and the low availability for
                        some disc games and console in general. Overall, the PS5 has been well-received as a significant
                        advancement in console gaming technology.</p>
